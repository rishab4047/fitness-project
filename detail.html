        <h1>GYM RULES </h1>
    </center>
    <br><br>

    <h3>
        Walk Away : If there is some type of object sitting on or around a piece of equipment.
        This is the international symbol for, “hey bro, this is taken.” The individual has
        either a gone to another area of the gym to do a superset3 b is getting water, or c
        is using the restroom. Regardless of the reason follow the code and don’t use the equipment
    </h3> <br>
    <h3>No Talking Mindset : One of the worst things you can do to a fellow gym goer is talk to them
        midset while they are attempting to focus on getting the most out of every rep. Wait until that
        set is over before speaking your mind.</h3> <br>
    <h3> Leave the Headphone Guy Alone : Headphones do not only mean the individual enjoys music it also means they do
        not want to be bothered. Headphones on means the rest of the world is turned off for that person.
    </h3> <br>
    <h3>Put Weights Where They Belon : The most annoying thing at a gym is when you go to look for the 80 pound
        dumbbells before eventually finding them in the spot where the 25 pounders go. If weights are placed in the
        wrong position it creates a perpetual cycle of misplaced dumbbells. Put the weights where they belong.
    </h3> <br>
    <h3> Don’t Hog the Weights : Hit most any gym in peak hours and you will know the struggle of not having a single
        dumbbell to work with. What’s worse is when one guy has all the weights — 30 to 80 pounders surrounding him
        because he’s doing dropsets. Don’t be THAT guy.
    </h3><br>

    </h3> <br>
    <h3>
        Let Others Work In : A common courtesy to follow for your fellow brother in iron is to let them work in with you
        between sets. If at all possible help your fellow brother out by offering your spot while resting between sets.
    </h3> <br>
    <h3> Wear Proper Footwear : The most cringing sight in the world is seeing a guy attempting to press 100-pound
        dumbbells in flip flops. Not only does this look stupid but the level of danger is unthinkable. Drop that weight
        on your foot and end up directly in the hospital.
    </h3> <br>
    <h3> Keep the Dryers to the Hands : These devices in the bathroom are called hand dryers for a reason … only use
        them for your hands. For whatever reason some guys think they can also dry other areas of their body with this
        equipment as well.
    </h3> <br>
    <h3>Don’t Critique Others : Unless someone has a strong likelihood of hurting themselves or others, do not correct
        their form. Keep the focus on yourself to avoid any unwanted gym drama and/or potential embarrassment.
    </h3> <br>
    <h3> Don’t Lift Heavy Without Spotter : Unless you want to be the meme that ends up all over Social Media 24 hours
        later make sure you have a spotter that will keep you from dying. If not you may get stuck on the bench with the
        barbell on your neck having to wiggle your way out from underneath it.
    </h3> <br>
    <h3>
        Don’t Gawk at the Hotties : Whether you are eyeballing the girl in yoga pants or admiring the physique of a dude
        from afar either way it is cool to stare. The only person you need to be focusing on is yourself in the mirror.
